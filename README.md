     Hypothesis:Securities become more stable the longer they remain public in the stock market
     Process:We gathered data of 4 popular technology stocks (IBM, Apple, Microsoft and Intel) that have been in the market for at least 30 years from "Quandl," which is a marketplace for financial, economic and alternative data.
     After that, we cleaned, and munged the data to come up with the "Stocks Percent Change MoM over the Security's Life Span","Stocks Volume Change MoM over the Security's Life Span","Stocks Closing Prices MoM over the Security's Life Span", and "Stocks Percent Change over each quater of the Securitiy's Life Span"; these values were used to plot charts.
